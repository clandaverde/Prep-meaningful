    <h1>Prep Norms and Exceptions</h1>
    <p>In chapter 6 Cairo describes various norms and exceptions in regards to how to properly determine data.</p>

    <h2><u>Norms &amp; Exceptions</u></h2>
    <p>One of the first things that's discussed is the process of visually exploring data. What that entails is finding patterns and trends that are within the data and then to observe deviations from those patterns. Next Cairo talks about mode, median and mean. Something which most of us are familiar with. Cairo tells us how using the mean value is not always the best way to calculate data and the reason why is because it can many times give you an outlier which is a value that's really high and off from the rest. However there is exceptions to this and that depends on several factors. A much better way to calculate the mean is by using weighted mean. The reason this is better is because it takes into account outside factors that influence your data. In the example presented in the book, it takes into account the number of students at each school. The mean, median and mode are definitely useful ways to gather data but sometimes thats not enough. In that case you could use range. Range offers another way to summarize information by showing you the difference between the maximum and minimum values. Lastly, a key thing that resonated with me was that when doing exploratory work we should never rely on just one example. It's important to gather as much information as possible. For this reason histograms, strip plots, lollipop charts etc. are all good ways to gather data.</p>
